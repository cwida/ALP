# Availability and Reproducibility Initiative Report

---

## 1. Source Code
- [Source code](/publication/source_code)

## 2. Software/Library Dependencies
- **Clang++**
- **CMake** (3.22 or higher)
- **Boost** (required for end-to-end benchmarks)

## 3. Hardware Requirements
- [Intel Ice Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Lake_(microprocessor)) (x86_64, AVX512): We recommend AWS instances like M6i and C6i.
- [AMD Zen 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_3) (x86_64, AVX2): We recommend AWS instances like M6a and C6a.
- [Apple M1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1)
- [AWS Graviton 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS_Graviton) (ARM64, NEON): We recommend AWS instances like M6g, C6g, R6g, and T4g.
- [AWS Graviton 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS_Graviton) (ARM64, NEON): We recommend AWS instances like M7g, C7g, and R7g.

> If you have any further questions about hardware recommendations, feel free to ask.

## 4. Data Collection and Plotting Scripts
- [Plotter](/publication/plotter): Collects data and generates all figures in the paper.
  - Figures are based on data in the repository and additional data produced by running the script.
- **Note**: The script for *Figure 6* is missing and needs to be completed.
- [Table Drawer](/publication/master_script/draw_table_4.py): Generates Table 4 from the paper.

## 5. Tables from Experimental Results
- The master script also generates experimental result tables in Markdown format.

## 6. Documentation
- Detailed instructions for compilation, deployment, execution, and script usage are provided in [BENCHMARKING.md](/BENCHMARKING.md).
- Guidelines explain how to replicate experiments and benchmarks from the [publication](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3626717).

## 7. Master Script
- [Master script](/publication/master_script/master_script.sh): Automates experiments, data collection, and workflow management.
- **Outputs**:
  - A log file (`master_script.log`) with step completion reports (green) and tables (brown).
- **MacBook Note**: The script requires `sudo` access to enable the cycle counter.
- **Font Warnings**: May require additional font installation, but do not impact functionality.

## 8. Deployment and Execution Estimates
- **Deployment time and effort**: X hours
- **Execution time**: Approximately 1 hour for the full workflow (for reviewer preparation)
