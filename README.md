This repository contains the source code and benchmarks for the paper [_ALP: Adaptive Lossless Floating-Point Compression_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3626717), published at ACM SIGMOD 2024.

**ALP** is a state-of-the-art lossless compression algorithm designed for IEEE 754 floating-point data. It encodes data by exploiting two common patterns found in real-world floating-point values:

- **Decimal Floating-Point Numbers**:  
  A large portion of floats/doubles in real-world datasets are decimals. ALP maps these values into integers by multiplying the number by a power of 10 and then compressing the result using a FastLanes variant of Frame-of-Reference encoding[^1], which is SIMD-friendly.  
  _Example_: the number `10.12` becomes `1012` and is then fed to the FastLanes encoder.

- **High-Precision Floating-Point Numbers**:  
  The remaining values are typically high-precision floats/doubles. ALP targets compression opportunities in only the left part of these values, which it compresses using FastLanes dictionary encoding. The right part is left uncompressed, as it is required to preserve high precision and is often highly random and incompressible.
